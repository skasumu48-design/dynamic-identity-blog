                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>If I had to pick a single word to describe myself, it would be <strong>dynam</strong>. To me, being dynamic means constantly evolving, adapting, and learning. I seldom stay static—whether it’s my opinions, goals, or worldview. Instead, I am perpetually in motion, embracing new experiences and perspectives. This trait didn't develop randomly. It stems from a cultural narrative. This narrative influences how I view myself and my role in a diverse world.</p>

                <h3>The Story: Moving, Adapting, Becoming</h3>
                <p>My family's migration story shapes my understanding of the word “dynamic.” My parents grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, where everything was familiar—language, food, traditions, and community. Nonetheless, economic hardships and limited opportunities changed their situation. They faced a tough decision. They had to leave their home and move to Toronto, Canada.</p>
                <p>The move was challenging. My childhood stories are filled with mixed feelings: excitement, fear, hope, and doubt. In their new country, my family had to adjust swiftly. They learned a new language. They found unfamiliar work. They maneuvere through a society that often didn't fully appreciate or understand their culture. Yet, they also clung to significant traditions—like food, festivals, stories, and values—that kept their roots alive.</p>
                <p>Not only is the move effective for me, but also how my family refused to view identity as fixed. What makes this story truly significant is their perspective. They didn't cease being who they were; instead, they added new layers to their identities. In a way, they became dynamic—anchored in one place while evolving into something else.</p>

                <h3>Personal Connection: Why This Makes Me Dynamic</h3>
                <p>Growing up with this story, I realized that change isn’t something to fear but something to embrace. Watching my family adapt while remaining true to who they are taught me that identity can develop and change. This experience has significantly shaped how I view myself.</p>
                <p>At school, I often switch between various groups and expectations. At home, I speak a certain language or follow specific customs. With friends, I often use different slang. I listen to different music or communicate in another language. I do not feel the need to select a single version of myself. Instead, I see these changes as part of my dynamic identity. I can belong to multiple spaces and still stay authentic.</p>
                <p>The story influenced how I approach challenges. When confronted with something new or difficult, I try not to shut down. This includes facing a challenging class, a misunderstanding, or a significant life change. I think of my family adapting to various changes, from climate to culture. If they learn to navigate entirely new systems, I believe I can also adjust to my situation. This is when my idea of “dynamic” becomes especially meaningful. It’s not just about staying busy or active. It’s about being open to change. It’s also about transformation when life calls for it.</p>

                <h3>EDI Reflection: Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Through a Dynamic Lens</h3>
                <h4>Equity: Different Storms, Different Starting Points</h4>
                <p>My family’s experience taught me about "Equity." When they moved to a new country, they didn't start on equal footing with others. They faced accents, unfamiliar qualifications, and less social capital than those already established. Occasionally, they were stereotyped or underestimated, even though they possessed strong skills.</p>
                <p>Growing up listening to these stories, I realized an important truth. People don't all start at the same point. This holds true even if they have equal effort or talent. Equity means recognizing these differences and offering support tailored to individual needs, rather than assuming "everyone has the same chances." My diverse identity drives me to look at systems comprehensively. I examine policies, attitudes, and institutions to see how they either support or hinder people like my family.</p>
                <h4>Diversity: Many Stories, Many Identities</h4>
                <p>Being dynamic allows me to value "Diversity". My family’s experience is just one example among many. At school, I interact with people from diverse backgrounds, religions, languages, and family histories. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by these differences, I find them fascinating. I understand that, just as my story has shaped me, their stories have also influenced who they are.</p>
                <p>Being dynamic means viewing culture as constantly evolving, rather than fixed or pure. It is shaped by migration, history, and personal choices. This perspective keeps me open to learning from others. I understand that diversity is not just an ideal but a tangible reality that brings new ideas, traditions, and perspectives into our environment communities.</p>
                <h4>Inclusion: Making Space for Changing Identities</h4>
                <p>Finally, my story and my words are deeply rooted in "inclusion". Inclusion goes beyond simply allowing people to join in. It involves creating environments where they can show their authentic selves. These environments also embrace their evolving identities. Having grown up navigating multiple cultures, I understand what it’s like to adapt myself to fit in. I also recognize how significant it is when someone makes space for my background, stories, and differences.</p>
                <p>Being dynamic means I embody that same openness toward others. In group settings, I notice who is quiet or seems out of place. When someone offers a different perspective, I listen attentively without dismissing it. My multifaceted identity is evolving. It makes me aware that people are never just one thing. They are always in the process of becoming, just like I am.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: A Moving Identity</h3>
                <p>My key word, 'dynamic,' goes beyond just a personality trait. It reflects a perspective on identity as something that evolves and reacts to the world. The story of my family’s migration illustrated that change can be difficult. It also showed that change can be empowering. This demonstrates that we can adjust without sacrificing our core self.</p>
                <p>This story has helped me understand that equity involves addressing unequal starting points. Diversity means valuing the many stories around us. Inclusion is about creating space for everyone’s evolving identity. My words and stories influence how I see myself. They shape how I work toward fostering a more understanding and inclusive world.</p>
